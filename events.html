                    -Vera Nazarian
                    Cannot fathom what to do with your wandering brain during the night?
                    Grid-nite offers you a challenging as well as a fun experience to keep yourself occupied. It's an over night event where participants will be given the grid the evening before and the answers will be collected the following morning. It involves creativity as well as presence of mind.
                    Participants will be provided with a grid which will carry words related to Earth Sciences. They have to solve the grid and find as many words as they can. Sounds easy, doesn't it?
                    Here's a twist - The competition isn't about finding the maximum number of words from the grid, it's about creating as many geologically meaningful sentences using these keywords.
                  </p>
                  </div>

                  <div style="display:none;">
                  <div id="Rules6">
                  1. Participants will be provided with a grid which contains specific words in the evening.<br>
                  2. The participants have to write all the words they were able to seek from the grid.<br><br>
                  After collecting these words, the participants have to go a step further and create *geologically meaningful* sentences and underline the used keyword from the grid and submit the final sentences and words the next morning.<br>
                  Marking scheme -<br>
                  1. The number of letters in each word equals to a single point. For instance, Dyke gets you 4 points and fault gets you 5 points.<br>
                  2. Overall score is calculated in the following way -<br>
                  Example - The words acquired from the grid are rock and magma.<br>
                  Sentence 1. *Rocks* are beautiful. ( 0 points, No geological meaning)<br>
                  Sentence 2. *Magma* is solid. (0 points, no geological significance)<br>
                  Sentence 3. *Rocks* are found beneath the earth's surface ( 5 + 1 points, makes sense, used 1 word from the grid)<br>
                  Sentence 4. *Magma* has a very high temperature. (5 + 1 points, makes sense, used 1 word from the grid)<br>
                  Sentence 5. *Rocks* are obtained from cooling of *magma*. (10 + 2 points, makes sense, used 2 words in the same sentence from the grid)
                  Note - The participants are allowed to use singular / plural form of these words wherever they find it adequate.<br>
                  Example - The words obtained from the grid are mineral and sediment.<br>
                  The following words will be legal - minerals and sediments.<br><br>

                  P.S. - No extra points for an extra S.<br>
                  P.P.S. - Plagiarism of any kind will be severely punished. ( 0 points will be given to each team with the same sentence )

                    The final round would be based on rock and mineral identification along with some index fossils' identification and the rules will be disclosed on the venue itself.<br>

                    5. The finals will be a challenging experience for you to maneuver the minerals, rock samples and some basic fossils through the various properties observing the streak, hardness, lustre, cleavages and other physical properties as well as to see the minerals in depth. In the context of fossils you will be required to identify some simple characteristics of the given fossils. A combination of these two is sure to complete a proper sweep of the student’s identification skills in all authenticity.

                                        Scientific Paper Presentation, The Platform for presenting research
                    Making Posters is the best way to convey information about a topic. Prithvi provides you a platform to present your research. Poster Presentation will require submission of poster on recently published papers or on-going research /projects in the field of Geoscience.
                    For Poster presentation, you can choose ANY topic related to Geoscience.
                    In the past, we had submissions from participants on varied topics ranging from unconventional hydrocarbons, plate tectonics, structural, stratigraphical and geo-chemical modelling to seismic analysis, near surface geophysics etc. Note that above topics are for giving example only. You are free to choose any topic but it should have direct or indirect relationship with Geosciences.

                     Scientific Paper Presentation, The Platform for presenting research
                    Making Posters is the best way to convey information about a topic. Prithvi provides you a platform to present your research. Poster Presentation will require submission of poster on recently published papers or on-going research /projects in the field of Geoscience.
                    For Poster presentation, you can choose ANY topic related to Geoscience.
                    In the past, we had submissions from participants on varied topics ranging from unconventional hydrocarbons, plate tectonics, structural, stratigraphical and geo-chemical modelling to seismic analysis, near surface geophysics etc. Note that above topics are for giving example only. You are free to choose any topic but it should have direct or indirect relationship with Geosciences.
